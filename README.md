# Image_classifier
AI Image Detective: Multi-Head Classifier. This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for building a deep learning model that performs dual-task classification. It identifies the subject of an image (e.g., cat, dog) while simultaneously detecting its source (Real vs. AI-generated). 
The system consists of a preprocessing utility for dataset labelling and a TensorFlow-powered multi-head neural network.🚀 Features: Automated Labelling: A script to bulk-rename AI-generated images with specific suffixes to prepare them for supervised learning. Multi-Head Architecture: Uses a shared MobileNetV2 backbone with two specialised output branches: Subject Head: Multi-class classification for identifying the object.
Source Head: Binary classification for AI vs. Real detection.Efficient Pipeline: Custom tf.data pipeline that extracts labels directly from directory structures and filenames on the fly.
Transfer Learning: Leverages pre-trained ImageNet weights for high accuracy with smaller datasets.📂 Project Structure: To ensure the scripts run correctly, organise your dataset folder as follows: Plaintextmy_dataset/
├── cat/
│   ├── image_01.jpg          <-- (Real Image)
│   ├── image_02_ai.jpg       <-- (AI-Generated Image)
├── dog/
│   ├── dog_vibe.png          <-- (Real Image)
│   └── dog_ai_01.png         <-- (AI-Generated Image)
Folder Names: Define the "Subject" classes.Filenames: Must contain the string ai to be labelled as AI-generated by the classifier.🛠️ Getting Started
1. Requirements
2. Python 3.x
3. TensorFlow 2.x
4. NumPy2.
Labelling your AI Images. Before training, use rename.py to tag your AI-generated files. Open rename.py and set TARGET_FOLDER to your directory containing AI images. Run the script:Bashpython rename.py
This appends _ai to the filenames, which the model uses to distinguish them from real photos.
3. Training the ModelOpen image_classifier.py and point BASE_DIR to your root dataset folder. Run the training script:Bashpython image_classifier.py
🧠 Model Logic: The classifier uses a weighted loss system to balance the two tasks: Output HeadActivationLoss FunctionWeightSubjectSoftmaxCategorical Crossentropy1.0Source (AI/Real)SigmoidBinary Crossentropy1.5
Why the 1.5 weight? The source detection (AI vs. Real) is often a more subtle task than object recognition; the higher weight encourages the model to focus more on the "AI artefacts" during training.📊
 Evaluation:
The script concludes by selecting a random image from your dataset and outputting a dual prediction:Object: (e.g., "Cat" with 98.5% confidence)Source: (e.g., "AI Generated" or "Real Image")
